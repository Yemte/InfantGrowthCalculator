The infant growth calculator android mobile application is a convenient applica-tion for parents with infant babies to check baby’s growth rate. The application allows the user to calculate baby’s weight gain rate, height increase rate and head circumference increase rate for boys and girls from birth up to one year separately and compares the result with world health organization (WHO) growth rate percentile standard charts /1/. 
The application was built based on world health organization child growth per-centile standards of tables and charts for both boys and girls from birth up to 12 months. The tables were used to generate the application’s calculation formula and to draw charts for world health organization standard percentiles and the calculation result. 
The calculator receives birth weight, current weight, birth height, current height, birth head circumference, current head circumference, gender and age from the user and calculates the percentile growth rate. It displays the result in the form of text and generates a graph for world health organization standard charts with the result for comparison purpose.
